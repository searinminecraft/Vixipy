# Alternatives for Vixipy

If you don't like Vixipy ( :( ) or are curious if there are
other pixiv frontends out there that you can use,
alternatives exist!

## PixivFE

[PixivFE](https://codeberg.org/pixivfe/pixivfe) is a free and open
source pixiv frontend written in [Go](https://go.dev) and licensed
under the GNU Affero General Public License. It has the same
principles of Vixipy: fast, free, cross-platform, privacy respecting
and, best of all, it just works. But it has a more intuitive design,
user interface and user experience. It is one of the best
alternative pixiv frontends you can use.

PixivFE was the inspiration for the creation of Vixipy (as a
challenge and to learn the Python programming language), but Vixipy
today has its very own set of unique features and principles (after
rewriting it multiple times)

## LiteXiv

[LiteXiv](https://codeberg.org/litexiv/litexiv) is a simple, just
works pixiv frontend written in PHP (ironically, the same
programming language that powwrs pixiv). It contains the necessary
basics for a pixiv frontend, decently fast and respects your privacy.
Like Vixipy and PixivFE, LiteXiv is also licensed under the GNU
Affero General Public License.
