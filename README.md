Vixipy [vick-see-pie] is a free and open source pixiv frontend. It allows you to use pixiv
and enjoy works without worrying about prying eyes.

> [!NOTE]
> You are looking at the `v3` branch, which is a rewrite of the entire code base. It is not
> production ready yet, so you should go back to the `main` branch. 
>
> Vixipy 2.7 will be the final version on the 2.x series, meaning no new features will be
> implemented.
