# PyXiv

</div>

PyXiv is yet another privacy respecting pixiv frontend, allowing you to enjoy content from pixiv without the tracking. Written in Python using the Flask web framework and other libraries.

This is still in heavy development, so it may take a while before it reaches a stable state.

# Features currently present
* Built-in proxy (to retrieve illustrations and images from pixiv)
* Log in
* Personalised landing page
